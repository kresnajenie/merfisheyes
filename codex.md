# Codex Session Summary

## Overview

This session focused on hardening the **XeniumAdapter** (and, earlier, the **MerscopeAdapter**) so large Xenium/MERSCOPE exports can be parsed quickly while pulling richer metadata from the official analysis outputs. Key improvements include streaming CSV/Zarr ingestion with PapaParse, archive extraction, curated gene lists, smarter cluster detection, and sparse matrix support.

## Major Changes

- **CSV Parsing** – Replaced hand-rolled string splitting with PapaParse in both adapters. Added streaming helpers that keep memory usage low and work for plain files, `.gz`, and data extracted from tar archives.
- **Archive Extraction** – Automatically opens `analysis.tar.gz` and `cell_feature_matrix.tar.gz` to surface clustering CSVs, `features.tsv`, `barcodes.tsv`, and `matrix.mtx` without manual unzipping.
- **Cluster Detection** – Scores every `analysis/clustering/*.csv`, prefers the `gene_expression_graphclust` folder, and chooses the column with the richest categorical labels. Adds heuristic fallbacks while avoiding per-cell-unique IDs.
- **Gene Handling** – Builds the gene list from `features.tsv` (even when headerless), records feature types, and filters negative-control/unassigned/deprecated codewords before exposing them. Falls back to `cells.csv` only when absolutely necessary.
- **Expression Ingestion**
  - Long-form `transcripts.csv(.gz)` remains the first choice.
  - Added sparse Matrix Market ingestion for `cell_feature_matrix/matrix.mtx(.gz)` with optional barcode alignment, automatic transposition detection, and streaming line parsing.
  - Disabled the memory-hungry `cells.csv` wide-column fallback when other sources fail or would allocate massive dense matrices.
- **MERSCOPE Adapter** – Mirrored the PapaParse refactor, improved feature/cluster loading, heuristically picked cluster columns, and shared the same streaming helpers.

## Implementation Notes

- Added utility functions to stream text from `File` objects (`readLinesFromFile`), parse headerless `features.tsv`, and read barcode lists while accommodating gzip compression.
- Gene filtering happens after expression ingestion so any negative-control vectors are discarded from both `_genes` and `_exprByGene`.
- Matrix ingestion now checks matrix dimensions against known cell/gene counts; if the matrix is transposed it transparently flips the interpretation.
- Cluster heuristics warn (but still join) when counts don’t align, making debugging easier.

## Known Limitations & Follow-ups

- Browser memory limits still apply—very large matrices (millions of entries) will eventually exhaust V8 heap despite the sparse ingest path.
- If both `transcripts.csv` and `matrix.mtx` are missing, expression remains unavailable (by design, to avoid the wide `cells.csv` fallback).
- Further optimization (e.g., chunked storage, WASM sparse math) would be required for 25 GB+ datasets.

## Suggested Next Steps

1. Offload massive matrices to the existing S3 chunked adapter or implement server-side preprocessing.
2. Add a user-facing indicator in the UI when expression could not be populated (e.g., missing transcripts/matrix files).
3. Consider caching the parsed matrix metadata so repeated loads are cheaper within a session.
